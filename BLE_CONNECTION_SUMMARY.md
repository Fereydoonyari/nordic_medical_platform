# BLE Connection Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

**Before**: Device was discoverable in nRF Connect but **not connectable** - no GATT services defined.

**After**: Device is now **fully connectable** and sends real-time medical data via BLE GATT!

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. BLE GATT Service Architecture
- Custom Medical Device Service (UUID: `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0`)
- 5 GATT characteristics for medical data:
  - Heart Rate (bpm)
  - Body Temperature (¬∞C)
  - Blood Oxygen SpO2 (%)
  - Motion Activity (g)
  - All Data Combined

### 2. Connection Management
- ‚úÖ Connection/disconnection callbacks
- ‚úÖ Automatic advertising restart on disconnect
- ‚úÖ Connection state tracking
- ‚úÖ LED indicators for connection status

### 3. Real-Time Data Transmission
- ‚úÖ Read characteristics on demand
- ‚úÖ Automatic notifications when data updates
- ‚úÖ Binary data format for efficiency
- ‚úÖ Updates every 15 seconds

### 4. Integration with Medical Data
- ‚úÖ Communication thread sends BLE GATT notifications
- ‚úÖ Medical data automatically pushed to connected apps
- ‚úÖ Connection status displayed in console
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with serial Bluetooth

## üìù Files Modified

### Configuration
- **app/prj.conf**: Added BLE GATT and settings support
  ```
  CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICE_CHANGED=y
  CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS=y
  CONFIG_BT_GATT_DYNAMIC_DB=y
  ```

### Hardware Layer (app/src/hardware.c & hardware.h)
- Added BLE GATT service definitions
- Implemented 5 characteristics with read/notify support
- Added connection callbacks (`bt_connected_cb`, `bt_disconnected_cb`)
- Created public API:
  - `hw_ble_update_medical_data()` - Update all medical data
  - `hw_ble_is_connected()` - Check connection status
  - `hw_ble_notify_characteristic()` - Send individual notifications

### Application Layer (app/src/main.c)
- Updated communication thread to call `hw_ble_update_medical_data()`
- Added connection status display
- Medical data automatically sent via GATT every 15 seconds

## üß™ How to Test

### Quick Test with nRF Connect App

1. **Build and flash**:
   ```bash
   cd app
   west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p
   west flash
   ```

2. **Open nRF Connect on Android**:
   - Tap SCAN
   - Find "NISC-Medical-Device"
   - Tap CONNECT
   - Wait for connection

3. **View medical data**:
   - Expand "Unknown Service"
   - Tap DOWN ARROW to read characteristics
   - Tap TRIPLE ARROW to enable notifications
   - Watch data update in real-time!

### Expected Behavior

**Serial Console**:
```
Bluetooth advertising started - Device discoverable
...
BLE device connected!
...
TRANSMITTING MEDICAL DATA PACKET #1
Via: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE GATT)
Status: CONNECTED - Data transmitted via GATT notifications
```

**LED Indicators**:
- LED1: Breathing pattern (system OK)
- LED2: Medical heartbeat pulse
- **LED3: Solid ON when BLE connected** ‚Üê NEW!
- LED4: Off (no errors)

**nRF Connect App**:
- Shows "NISC-Medical-Device" in scan
- Connection succeeds
- 5 characteristics visible
- Data readable and notifications work

## üìä Data Format

All values are **little-endian** (LSB first):

| Characteristic | Size | Format | Example | Decoded |
|---------------|------|--------|---------|---------|
| Heart Rate | 2 bytes | uint16_t | `48 00` | 72 bpm |
| Temperature | 2 bytes | int16_t | `6E 01` | 366 ‚Üí 36.6¬∞C |
| SpO2 | 2 bytes | uint16_t | `D4 03` | 980 ‚Üí 98.0% |
| Motion | 2 bytes | uint16_t | `0A 00` | 10 ‚Üí 1.0g |
| All Data | 8 bytes | struct | Combined | All values |

**Decoding**: Divide temperature, SpO2, and motion by 10 to get actual values.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Device Not Connectable
**Check**: Serial console shows "Bluetooth advertising started"
**Solution**: Verify BLE is enabled in prj.conf

### Connection Fails
**Check**: Only one device can connect at a time
**Solution**: Disconnect other devices or power cycle

### No GATT Services
**Check**: Wait for service discovery (few seconds)
**Solution**: Tap refresh or reconnect

### Notifications Not Working
**Check**: Triple arrow icon should be blue
**Solution**: Ensure notifications enabled on characteristic
