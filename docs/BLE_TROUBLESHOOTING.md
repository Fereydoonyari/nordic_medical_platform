# BLE Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚ùå Problem: Bluetooth Not Discoverable

If your device is not appearing in nRF Connect or other BLE scanner apps, follow this systematic troubleshooting guide.

## üîç Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check Serial Console Output

Connect via USB and monitor the serial console. You should see:

```
=== NISC Medical Wearable Device Starting ===
...
Initializing Bluetooth advertising...
Enabling Bluetooth...
Bluetooth enabled successfully
Bluetooth advertising initialized successfully
...
Starting BLE advertising as 'NISC-Medical-Device'...
‚úì Bluetooth advertising started successfully - Device should be discoverable now!
  Device Name: NISC-Medical-Device
  Look for it in nRF Connect app
```

**What to Check**:
- ‚úÖ "Bluetooth enabled successfully" appears
- ‚úÖ "Bluetooth advertising started successfully" appears
- ‚úÖ No error messages about Bluetooth

**If you see errors**:
- Note the error code (e.g., "Bluetooth enable failed with error -22")
- See error code reference below

### Step 2: Verify Build Configuration

Check that your `prj.conf` has these settings:

```ini
# Essential BLE settings
CONFIG_BT=y
CONFIG_BT_PERIPHERAL=y
CONFIG_BT_BROADCASTER=y
CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME="NISC-Medical-Device"
CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICE_CHANGED=y

# Memory (must be sufficient)
CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=4096
CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE=4096

# BLE buffers
CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT=8
CONFIG_BT_ATT_PREPARE_COUNT=2
```

### Step 3: Rebuild with Clean Build

```bash
cd app
rm -rf build
west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p
west flash
```

The `-p` flag ensures a pristine build.

### Step 4: Check Board Connection

**nRF52840 DK**:
- USB cable connected to "nRF USB" port (not external power)
- Power LED should be ON
- Reset button (SW1) pressed after flashing
- No other USB cables connected

**Button Check**:
- Press Button 1 - LED should respond
- If no response, power cycle the board

### Step 5: Check Android Settings

**Bluetooth**:
- Bluetooth must be ON
- Location services must be ON (Android requirement for BLE scanning)
- Grant nRF Connect all permissions

**nRF Connect App**:
- Latest version installed
- Permissions granted: Bluetooth, Location, Nearby Devices
- Try force-closing and reopening the app
- Clear app cache if issues persist

### Step 6: Test on Different Device

Try scanning with:
- Different Android phone
- iOS device with LightBlue app
- Another nRF52840 DK running nRF Connect Desktop
- Raspberry Pi with `hcitool lescan`

## üêõ Common Error Codes

### Error -12 (ENOMEM)
**Meaning**: Out of memory

**Solutions**:
1. Increase stack sizes in `prj.conf`:
   ```ini
   CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=8192
   CONFIG_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE=8192
   ```
2. Increase BLE buffer count:
   ```ini
   CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT=10
   CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_RX_SIZE=251
   CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_TX_SIZE=251
   ```

### Error -22 (EINVAL)
**Meaning**: Invalid parameter

**Solutions**:
1. Check device name length (must be < 30 characters)
2. Verify advertising data format
3. Ensure CONFIG_BT_DEVICE_NAME matches code

### Error -5 (EIO)
**Meaning**: I/O error, hardware issue

**Solutions**:
1. Check board is nRF52840 (not nRF52832)
2. Verify correct board target in build
3. Flash SoftDevice if using older SDK
4. Power cycle the board

### Error -114 (EALREADY)
**Meaning**: Bluetooth already enabled

**Solutions**:
1. This is usually harmless
2. Code might be calling bt_enable() twice
3. Check initialization order

## üîß Advanced Debugging

### Enable Full BLE Debug Logging

Add to `prj.conf`:
```ini
CONFIG_BT_DEBUG_LOG=y
CONFIG_BT_DEBUG_HCI_CORE=y
CONFIG_LOG_MODE_IMMEDIATE=y
CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=4
```

Rebuild and check console for detailed BLE stack messages.

### Check with West Build Verbose

```bash
west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p -- -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
```

Look for compilation warnings about BLE.

### Verify Zephyr SDK Version

```bash
west --version
```

Should be 3.0 or newer. Update if older:
```bash
west update
```

### Test Minimal BLE Sample

Test with Zephyr's minimal BLE peripheral sample:
```bash
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr
west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 samples/bluetooth/peripheral -p
west flash
```

If this doesn't work, it's a toolchain/SDK issue, not your code.

## üìä Expected Behavior Checklist

When everything is working:

- [ ] Serial console shows "Bluetooth enabled successfully"
- [ ] Serial console shows "Bluetooth advertising started successfully"
- [ ] LED3 (Communication) is blinking slowly
- [ ] nRF Connect shows "NISC-Medical-Device" in scan list
- [ ] Device shows as "Connectable" in nRF Connect
- [ ] RSSI value appears (signal strength)
- [ ] Can tap "CONNECT" button

## üéØ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Remove Settings Storage

If you see errors about settings/flash, disable them:

```ini
# In prj.conf, comment out:
# CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS=y
# CONFIG_SETTINGS=y
# CONFIG_FLASH=y
# CONFIG_NVS=y
```

These are optional and can cause issues.

### Fix 2: Use Simpler Advertising

Replace advertising code with basic parameters:

```c
// In hw_ble_advertising_start()
int ret = bt_le_adv_start(BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME, ad, ARRAY_SIZE(ad), NULL, 0);
```

This uses standard connectable advertising.

### Fix 3: Check Board Overlay

Ensure `nrf52840dk_nrf52840.overlay` doesn't disable Bluetooth pins or peripherals.

### Fix 4: Flash Bootloader

Some boards need MCUboot bootloader:

```bash
west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y
west flash
```

### Fix 5: Erase Flash Completely

```bash
nrfjprog --eraseall
west flash
```

This clears any bad settings stored in flash.
