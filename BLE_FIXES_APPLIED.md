# BLE Discoverability Fixes Applied

## üîß Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Duplicate Stack Size Configuration ‚ùå
**Problem**: `CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE` was defined twice with conflicting values
```ini
Line 10: CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=2048
Line 89: CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=4096  # Duplicate!
```

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Removed duplicate, kept 4096 (needed for BLE)

### Issue #2: Missing BLE Buffers ‚ùå
**Problem**: No BLE buffer configuration for GATT data

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Added proper BLE buffer configuration:
```ini
CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT=8
CONFIG_BT_ATT_PREPARE_COUNT=2
CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_RX_SIZE=251
CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_TX_SIZE=251
```

### Issue #3: Settings Storage Causing Issues ‚ùå
**Problem**: `CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS` enabled without proper flash configuration

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Disabled settings (not needed for basic BLE):
```ini
# CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS=y  # Commented out
# CONFIG_SETTINGS=y
# CONFIG_FLASH=y
# CONFIG_NVS=y
```

### Issue #4: Non-Connectable Advertising Parameters ‚ùå
**Problem**: Using custom advertising parameters that might not be connectable

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Changed to standard connectable advertising:
```c
// Before:
bt_le_adv_start(BT_LE_ADV_PARAM(BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_IDENTITY, ...), ...)

// After:
bt_le_adv_start(BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME, ad, ARRAY_SIZE(ad), NULL, 0);
```

### Issue #5: Missing Device Name in BLE Stack ‚ùå
**Problem**: Device name only in advertising data, not set in BLE stack

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Added `bt_set_name()` call:
```c
bt_set_name(ble_state.device_name);
```

### Issue #6: Insufficient Debug Logging ‚ùå
**Problem**: Hard to diagnose BLE initialization issues

**Fix**: ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging:
```c
printk("Enabling Bluetooth...\n");
// ... bt_enable() ...
printk("Bluetooth enabled successfully\n");
printk("‚úì Bluetooth advertising started successfully - Device should be discoverable now!\n");
```

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **app/prj.conf**
   - Fixed duplicate stack sizes
   - Added BLE buffers
   - Disabled problematic settings storage
   - Added debug logging options

2. **app/src/hardware.c**
   - Changed to BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME for advertising
   - Added bt_set_name() call
   - Enhanced logging throughout BLE init
   - Better error messages

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Clean Build and Flash

```bash
cd app
rm -rf build
west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -p
west flash
```

### 2. Check Serial Console

You should now see:
```
Initializing Bluetooth advertising...
Enabling Bluetooth...
Bluetooth enabled successfully
Bluetooth advertising initialized successfully
...
Starting BLE advertising as 'NISC-Medical-Device'...
‚úì Bluetooth advertising started successfully - Device should be discoverable now!
  Device Name: NISC-Medical-Device
  Look for it in nRF Connect app
```

### 3. Scan with nRF Connect

- Open nRF Connect app
- Tap SCAN
- Look for **"NISC-Medical-Device"**
- Should appear with:
  - Connectable: Yes
  - RSSI: Signal strength value
  - Advertising data visible

### 4. Verify LED

- LED3 (Communication) should be **blinking slowly** when advertising
- LED3 will go **solid ON** when connected

## üéØ Expected Results

After these fixes:

‚úÖ **Bluetooth initializes successfully**
- No errors in console
- Stack has sufficient memory
- BLE subsystem ready

‚úÖ **Advertising starts properly**
- Uses connectable advertising type
- Device name set correctly
- Advertising data formatted properly

‚úÖ **Device is discoverable**
- Appears in nRF Connect scan
- Shows as "Connectable"
- Can be selected for connection

‚úÖ **Connection works**
- Can connect from nRF Connect
- GATT services visible
- Medical data characteristics accessible

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Still Not Discoverable:

1. **Check Console Output**:
   - Look for "Bluetooth enabled successfully"
   - Check for any error codes
   - See [BLE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/BLE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

2. **Android Requirements**:
   - Bluetooth ON
   - Location services ON (required for BLE scanning!)
   - nRF Connect has all permissions

3. **Power Cycle**:
   - Unplug nRF52840 DK
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Plug back in
   - Press RESET button

4. **Try Different Scanner**:
   - iOS LightBlue app
   - Another Android phone
   - nRF Connect Desktop (PC/Mac)

### Common Error Codes:

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| -12 | Out of memory | Increase stack sizes to 8192 |
| -22 | Invalid parameter | Check device name length |
| -5 | I/O error | Wrong board or hardware issue |

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once device is discoverable:

1. **Connect in nRF Connect**:
   - Tap "CONNECT"
   - Wait for connection
   - Explore GATT services

2. **Enable Notifications**:
   - Expand Medical Device Service
   - Tap triple-arrow icon on characteristics
   - Watch real-time medical data

3. **Build Custom App**:
   - Use UUIDs from BLE_GATT_GUIDE.md
   - Implement BLE scanning and connection
   - Parse binary medical data format
